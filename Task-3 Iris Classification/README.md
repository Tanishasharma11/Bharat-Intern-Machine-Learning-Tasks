# Iris Classification

The code in this project performs Iris flower classification using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow. 

1. The dataset is loaded from scikit-learn's Iris dataset, split into training and testing sets, and standardized for model training.

2. The neural network consists of one hidden layer with 64 neurons and an output layer with three units for Iris classes.

3. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.


4. After training for 50 epochs, the accuracy is evaluated on the test set, providing insights into the model's performance.
